##### Who am I?

My name is Paolo Riccardi and I've been a Computer Science enthusiast since childhood.
I knew I was hooked in from the first moment I saw that boxy cursor of my older brother Commodore 64. 

I switched from Logo and Basic to Pascal and electric guitars in High School. I discovered Slackware and fell in love with Linux and Open Source and more broadly with Hacking as a mindset. 

While at University I started using regularly C and Java, which were joined over the years by Php, Objective C and Python... and I've just bought a Go manual which is on top of my tech books backlog. 

While at University I discovered distributed systems under the form of process calculus and concurrency theory. Although under a less theoretical perspective, distributed systems are still nowadays my favourite area of technical expertise.

Over the years, before I knew it, my passion became my full time job.
Now I live in Tuscany (Italy), where I graduated in Computer Science (BS & MS) and where I work as Solution Architect for a consulting company. 

##### What else?

I like to tease my brain whenever possible, I'm an avid reader expecially of History and Science books. 

I currently hold a third dan black belt in Aikido and Iâ€™m a certified instructor, if you want to know more on this topic you can visit my [blog](http://www.kinonagare.it){:target="_blank"} (mainly in italian) or my [video channel](https://vimeo.com/kinonagare){:target="_blank"} on Vimeo.

I love cooking, hiking and taking photographs, you can browse my Flickr [photo gallery](https://www.flickr.com/photos/priccardi/){:target="_blank"}.
