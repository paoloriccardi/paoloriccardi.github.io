##### Hi,
This is my online resume, here you will find information about my [Professional](/Professional/) career as well as a glance on what I'm doing in my spare time about computer science related topics, readings, reviews, pet projects etc...

I've realized that the process to translate a new concept to others is very helpful in consolidating my own understanding of that concept, so I'm trying to include this translation process into my study routine. 
Hopefully I'll be able to put some of those things as posts in the [Linenoise](/Linenoise/) section.

##### Where does the name come from?
Burning Chrome is the title of a ~~science fict~~ CyberPunk short story by [William Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson){:target="_blank"}, the name was actually so good that it was chosen for a volume which collected several short stories from the same author. I've loved both the novel and the volume as well as the Sprawl trilogy.
