##### Business Processes
I've been working with Business Processes for a while. A business process can be defined as a set of *structured* activities that, once completed, contribute to accomplish a business goal/company goal or more simply, to deliver a service or a product to a customer.
Business Processes are the encoding of that a company does and of how all the company internal mechanisms, departments, resources, protocols, etc.. works.
This code is not executed always the way it was intended, people may find workaround to cover cornercases that were not foreseen by the process initial design. So processes evolves like they are a living things, they mutate. 

That's why organizations can be a very complex subject of study and analyze, even using data driven approaches. I'm leaving the topic on process analysis with data driven techniques for another post. What will be enough for today is a simple concept, every attrition in a machinery generates inefficiency and this concept apply organizations are no different. Just like ktrange rattling, unusual noises, smokey smells are bad signs for an engine even organizations have their bad omens.  

##### Bad Omens
If you look around in any Department of a decent sized company, you'll probably be able to find an abundance of: 
1. Excel files (or any other datasheet/spreadsheet you like)
2. Emails

I know this may sound weird to people with a purely technical background but just take a moment and look at your Project Manager, your Line Manager, your head of department/head of sales, head of whatever... he's in this kind of trouble every day of the week that ends with *Y*.
And this is not a habit that concerns just organizational roles... I know you sometime email Steve, the guy in charge of your company kubernetes cluster or maybe Sarah the girl who manage your cloudformation stuff to ask for something without using the standard, time consuming, boring channels, so before you think everything's alright... well think again.
Of course you may work in a company that is not in this situation, well... good for you. 

As you may have guessed by now, spreadsheets and emails are both bad omens.

Some departments are so polluted with both that you won't be able to find a single process that's not relying on spreadsheet for project management, resource accounting, inventory management, order tracking or task lists and on emails for off-the-record communications when something diverges from the typical workflow (or sometimes even when everything is following the golden path). 

Don't get me wrong, spreadsheet and emails can be useful, if you're in trouble they will save your day again and again but their abuse and their spread is a clear signal that something is wrong. Why? Because as they say *Unhappy the land that is in need of heroes*.

##### Why are spreadsheet a bad omen? 
The first spreadsheet software was called [VisiCalc]{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VisiCalc} and it's impact on the computer industry in 1979 was huge.

Spreadsheets have rock solid reasons to be so widely used:
- easy to use for users who don't have a programming background
- perfect for quick and dirty tactical tools 

I'll repeat this, sometimes it's totally fine to use spreadsheets as long as one is aware of their limitations and of the unintended consequences.

Let's assume every project manager in a specific department uses spreadsheets to record her project schedule/gantt charts. Let's assume you're the department manager and you want to know how projects are going now. What do you do? You will have to ask every PM to brief you or to send you their project plan. If you have a lot of projects going on in your department you're facing a long day. And what if you wanted to know about last quarter projects? PMs should search for the right version of the right file just for the purpose.

In other words, every PM has created his own information silo, the worst part is that the creation of those siloes was not cheap, because every had to create, modify, review and update the plan constantly. 

What if instead of project plan we wanted to check sales, which were tracked by our sales managers? Again we will have to run through any single file in any single laptop, wherever they may be.

But nonetheless spreadsheet are commonly used, why? 
Well here it comes that strange noise from the engine you should be aware of, you don't know what's the problem but you know it's not good. Proliferation of spreadsheets may have different causes, among which:
- Your company doesn't have the right IT tools 
- Your company's IT is so full of work just trying to keep the lights up that people prefer the do it yourself approach
- The IT tools that support the process have blind spots
- People hide things
 



In other words, why do you need to trade emails with your colleague over a bugfix? Because something is not clear in your tracking system for example, or maybe because you need to notify your manager that you're going to take care of it and you will need some time. On the other hand why do you need to use a spreadsheet to track a project or to record this quarter prospects? Because you don't have any other IT tool to support you.
