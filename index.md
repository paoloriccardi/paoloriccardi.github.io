##### Hi

I'm Paolo Riccardi and this is my online resume, you'll find more details about me and my contacts in the [About](/About/) section. 

For more information on my career you can go straight to the [Resume](/Resume/) section.

This website was born mainly to share my experiences on IT, over the years I've realized that the process to translate a new concept to others is very helpful in consolidating my own understanding of that concept, so I'm trying to include this process into my study routine. 
Hopefully I'll be able to put some of those things as posts in the [Linenoise](/Linenoise/) section.

##### Where does the name come from?
*"It was hot the night we burned Chrome"*. That's how Burning Chrome, a short ~~science fict~~ CyberPunk novel by [William Gibson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gibson){:target="_blank"} started. The novel gave the title to a whole volume which collected other remarkable short stories from the same author (*Johnny Mnemonic*, just to mention one of them). 

I first read the novel in my teen years and somehow it managed to stay stuck into my mind so far, so I decided it was a good name after all.
