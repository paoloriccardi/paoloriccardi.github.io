##### What can I do for you?
I've a 10+ years experience in software and IT, with particular emphasis on backend services and integration components, over the last years I focused particularly on distributed systems, cloud computing and data processing.

I love the solutioning process, I do enjoy tackling problems in order to find solutions.
I'm curious and I'm a quick learner, I like keeping up to date with IT trends and generally I love learning new and smart ways of doing things, so study is still an important part of my daily routine.

I'm comfortable in the "engine room". Over the years I managed to combine a solid technical background with soft skills and business process awareness which allowed me to play both inside and outside the IT domain. This combination has proven valuable inside bluechip companies to fill in the gap between IT and other Enterprise departments.

I'm also comfortable with people. My experience in consulting brought me close to customer needs which helped me understanding them in order to provide good solutions and valuable options, each time delivered with the help of my team. As time went by I enjoyed taking leadership roles, which means team management, technical lead, mentorship and a huge load of learning.
