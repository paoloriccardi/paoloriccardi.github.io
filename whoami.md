##### Who am I?

My name is Paolo Riccardi and I've been a Computer Science enthusiast since childhood.
I knew I was hooked in from the moment when, as a child, I saw for the first time the blinking, boxy cursor of my older brother's Commodore 64. 

I switched from Logo and Basic to Pascal and electric guitars in High School, then I discovered Slackware and fell in love with Linux and Open Source and more broadly with Hacking as a mindset. 

While at University I started using regularly C and Java, which were joined over the years by Php, Objective C and Python (revived by the use of *pyspark* over the last years) and last but definitely not least, Go with a little help from the amazing [Learning Go](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go/9781492077206/){:target="_blank"}. To be honest with Go it wasn't love at first sight, expecially because I came from a very long experience with a rather forgiving language such as Python but, after the initial impact, Go has become the language of choice for my pet projects. 

While at University I discovered distributed systems under the form of process calculus and concurrency theory. Although under a less theoretical perspective, distributed systems are still nowadays my favourite area of technical expertise, often paired with data intensive sytems.

Over the years, before I knew it, my passion became my full time job.
Now I live in Tuscany (Italy), where I graduated in Computer Science (BS & MS) and where I work as Solution Architect for a consulting company focused on data mangament, data processing, data analysis and more broadly using data to bring value to enterprises.

##### What else?

I like to tease my brain whenever possible, I'm an avid reader expecially of History and Science books. 

I currently hold a third dan black belt in Aikido and Iâ€™m a certified instructor, if you want to know more on this topic you can visit my [blog](http://www.kinonagare.it){:target="_blank"} (mainly in italian) or my [video channel](https://vimeo.com/kinonagare){:target="_blank"} on Vimeo.

I love cooking, hiking and taking photographs, you can watch some of my shots on my Flickr [photo gallery](https://www.flickr.com/photos/priccardi/){:target="_blank"}.
