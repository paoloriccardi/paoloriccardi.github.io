##### What can I do for you?
I've a 10+ years experience in software and IT, with particular emphasis on backend services and integration components, over the last years I focused particularly on distributed systems and cloud computing.

I love the solutioning process, I do enjoy tackling problems in order to find solutions.
I'm curious and I'm a quick learner, I like keeping up to date with IT trends and generally I love learning new and smart ways of doing things, so study is still an important part of my daily routine.

I'm comfortable in the "engine room". A solid technical background, combined with soft skills and business process awareness have made me appreciated both inside and outside the IT domain. This combination has proven valuable inside bluechip companies to smooth the interactions between IT and other Enterprise Departments.
