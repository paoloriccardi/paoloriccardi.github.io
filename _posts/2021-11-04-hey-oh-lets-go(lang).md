description: I finally gave it a chance and I started to study Go. I've been programming more or less continuously for the latest 20 years or so and thus I gathered some experience with various programming languages. Yet Go felt different from the first impact, here are the first few things that struck me.

##### Introduction
If you've been in computer science long enough you have seen a lot of new kid on the block, hot technologies that eventually proved the test of time or less fortunate one that sinked in a sprawling see of buzzwords waiting for their time to shine again.

So when the industry comes out with the new "cool thing" that everybody want to put on their resume you start being cautious. [Go](https://golang.org/){:target="_blank"} has been around for a while if we consider that it was first announced in 2009 and it is continuously getting momentum.

So I finally did it, I picked up the excellent [Learning Go](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/learning-go/9781492077206/){:target="_blank"} by Jon Bodner from my backlog of books and I gave it a try.
